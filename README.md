# Global-Air-Pollutant-Forecasting-Using-Sequential-Transfer-Learning
This repository presents the code and structure for the MSc thesis “Global Air Pollutant Forecasting Using Sequential Transfer Learning: Addressing the Cold Start Problem.”
The project introduces a globally generalizable deep learning model capable of forecasting PM2.5 and PM10 air pollutant concentrations, even in data-scarce (cold-start) regions.
